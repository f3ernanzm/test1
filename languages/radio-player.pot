"There could be several reasons why the current song title isn’t displaying on your player. One common reason is that the player is not receiving the stream metadata from the server. This can happen if the server doesn’t provide the metadata, or if the player is not configured to display it.\n"

"To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Check if the stream has metadata: If the metadata is not present, then it won’t be possible to display the current song title on the player.</li>\n"
"<li>Make sure the “Show Track Title” setting is enabled in the player controls settings.</li>\n"
"<li>Make sure <b>allow_url_fopen</b> is enabled on the server: If allow_url_fopen is disabled on the server, the player won’t be able to retrieve the metadata from the stream. You can contact your web host to enable this setting or modify the server configuration yourself if you have access.</li>\n"
